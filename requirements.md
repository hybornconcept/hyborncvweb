### **1. Project Setup**
1. **Initialize SvelteKit Project**:
   - Create a new SvelteKit project with TypeScript.
   - Set up routing for the three pages (`/`, `/auth`, `/users`).
2. **Install shadcn-svelte**:
   - Follow the official shadcn-svelte documentation to configure it.
   - Import and use pre-built components like `Button`, `Input`, `Form`, etc.
3. **Install PocketBase SDK**:
   - Add the PocketBase JavaScript SDK to your project.
4. **Set Up PocketBase**:
   - Run PocketBase locally or use a hosted instance.
   - Create collections for `users` and `resumes` in PocketBase.

### **2. Plan the Application Structure**
1. **Define Pages**:
   - **Landing Page**: Showcase the value proposition, features, and CTAs.
   - **Auth Page**: Handle user login and sign-up.
   - **Users Page**: Display user profile, resume submission, and review status.
2. **Design UI Flow**:
   - Use shadcn-svelte components to ensure a consistent and polished UI.
   - Plan the layout for each page, focusing on usability and responsiveness.

### **3. Build the Landing Page**
1. **Header/Hero Section**:
   - Use shadcn-svelte’s `Card` and `Button` components for the hero section.
   - Add a CTA button linking to the Auth Page.
2. **Features/Benefits Section**:
   - Use `Grid` and `Card` components to display features with icons.
3. **Testimonials Section**:
   - Use `Carousel` or `Card` components to showcase testimonials.
4. **Pricing Section**:
   - Use `Table` or `Card` components to display pricing plans.
5. **FAQs and Contact Section**:
   - Use `Accordion` for FAQs and `Form` for the contact section.

---

### **4. Build the Auth Page**
1. **Design Login and Sign-Up Forms**:
   - Use shadcn-svelte’s `Form`, `Input`, and `Button` components.
   - Add validation using `zod` for email and password fields.
2. **Integrate PocketBase Auth**:
   - Use the PocketBase SDK to handle user authentication.
   - Redirect authenticated users to the Users Page.
3. **Handle Errors**:
   - Display validation and authentication errors using `FormMessage`.

---

### **5. Build the Users Page**
1. **User Profile Section**:
   - Fetch and display user data from PocketBase.
   - Allow profile updates using a form with shadcn-svelte components.
2. **Resume Submission Section**:
   - Create a file upload form using `Input` (type="file").
   - Upload resumes to PocketBase and associate them with the user.
3. **Resume Review Status**:
   - Display a list of submitted resumes and their status using `Table`.
   - Allow users to download reviewed resumes.
4. **Logout Functionality**:
   - Add a logout button to clear the PocketBase session.

---

### **6. Manage Application State**
1. **Use Svelte Stores**:
   - Create a centralized store for user data and resume submissions.
   - Use derived stores for computed values (e.g., resume status).
2. **Pass Data Between Components**:
   - Use props and context to share data between parent and child components.

---

### **7. Implement Validation**
1. **Define Validation Schemas**:
   - Use `zod` to create schemas for form fields (e.g., email, password, file uploads).
2. **Validate Before Submission**:
   - Validate form data before allowing users to proceed.
3. **Display Errors**:
   - Use shadcn-svelte’s `FormMessage` to show validation errors.

---

### **8. Handle Navigation**
1. **Track Current Page**:
   - Use SvelteKit’s routing to manage navigation between pages.
2. **Conditional Rendering**:
   - Render components based on the user’s authentication status.

---

### **9. Submit Data to PocketBase**
1. **Initialize PocketBase Client**:
   - Set up the PocketBase client in a reusable module.
2. **Submit Resumes**:
   - Upload resumes to PocketBase and store metadata (e.g., user ID, status).
3. **Handle Errors**:
   - Display error messages if submission fails.
4. **Show Success Feedback**:
   - Use shadcn-svelte’s `Toast` component to show success messages.

---

### **10. Style the Application**
1. **Use shadcn-svelte Styles**:
   - Leverage pre-built styles for consistency.
2. **Customize as Needed**:
   - Add custom styles to match your branding.
3. **Ensure Responsiveness**:
   - Use shadcn-svelte’s responsive utilities for mobile-friendly layouts.

---

### **11. Test the Application**
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test critical components (e.g., forms, file uploads).
2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interactions between SvelteKit and PocketBase.
3. **User Testing**:
   - Conduct usability testing for all pages and flows.

---

### **12. Deploy the Application**
1. **Build for Production**:
   - Run `npm run build` to generate the production build.
2. **Deploy SvelteKit**:
   - Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or another hosting platform.
3. **Deploy PocketBase**:
   - Host PocketBase on a cloud service (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS).

---

### **13. Post-Launch Activities**
1. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Use tools like Google Analytics or Sentry to track errors and usage.
2. **Gather Feedback**:
   - Collect user feedback to identify areas for improvement.
3. **Iterate and Improve**:
   - Regularly update the app based on user needs and feedback.
